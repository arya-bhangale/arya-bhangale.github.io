      <h2>Design Process</h2>
      <p>
        As a member of FIRST Robotics Competition Team 1923, The MidKnight Inventors for 4 years, I'd learned a lot about the
        design process and mechanical systems. This robot is from our 2025 season, where I was a Mechanical Captain on the team 
        as well as the Robot Operator. Our design process for this robot started at our kickoff where we learned about the competition's rules and 
        what the field would look like during the season. Based on the game given to us, we then narrowed down the potential 
        robot archetypes based on what they could do and how they would allow us to gain points. After this, we narrowed it down even
        further and thought about what we wanted our specific robot to do, and after we had decided that we wanted our robot to 
        focus on coral we began prototyping. To begin prototyping we researched games that had been similar to this one, and how teams
        had gone about designing their subsystems for these games. After we isolated a few designs to prototype, we iterated on our prototypes
        until we found ones that fit our archetypes and were the most modular. We then CAD'ed our ideas and fabricated them, and kept iterating
        on what could be improved and what needed to be added.
